# Future Development:
- I want to be able have an external api, for example: [IGDB](https://igdb.github.io/api/) or 
[Giant Bomb](https://www.giantbomb.com/api/).

- Would like to have a search bar with the external api integrated to where users can search up unlimited amounts of game option so that they can like and follow.

- Have more data showing up like gameplay videos and screen shots.
